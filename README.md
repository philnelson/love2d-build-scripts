# Hey
I originally built these to make it easier to deploy [the games I make][1] on itch.io. They should be pretty self-explainatory, provided you use the folder setup specified.

# Folder Setup

These scripts _all_ depend on your game folder being set up like this:

* Main Game Folder
* * Game Folder (which has main.lua etc in it)
* * Bin (Contains all of the .zip distribtiuon files from love2d.org)
* * * Release (will contain your zipped up distro files)
